# Welcome! 👋🏽

I'm Aditya; a quantum computing postdoc at Sandia National Laboratory. 

I was formerly an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [DDF Fellow](https://grad.umn.edu/funding/current-students/doctoral-dissertation-fellowship) at the University of Minnesota. I work on fun topics in neural networks, quantum information, holography, and black holes. A while back I helped develop software for the Wolfram [QuantumFrameworks](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframquantumframework/DeployedResources/Paclet/Wolfram/QuantumFramework/) package to perform numerical and analytical calculations on quantum computers.
