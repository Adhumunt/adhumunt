### Welcome! 👋🏽

I'm Aditya; an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> and a <a href="https://grad.umn.edu/funding/current-students/doctoral-dissertation-fellowship">DDF Fellow</a> at the University of Minnesota. Currently, I'm working at Wolfram Research developing software for the [QuantumFrameworks](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/wolframquantumframework/DeployedResources/Paclet/Wolfram/QuantumFramework/) package to perform numerical and analytical calculations on quantum computers. 

Previously, I completed  <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html">Part III</a> of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge during 2016-2017. 

Before starting my Ph.D, I was a vistor at the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> in the <a href="https://nafshordi.com/">Afshordi</a> group from 2017-2018.

My publications can be found <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1669979">here</a>. My prior and current research interests are [here](https://www.dhuality.com/research/).
